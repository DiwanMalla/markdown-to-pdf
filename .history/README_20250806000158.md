This is a web app built with [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) that lets you:

- Write or paste Markdown in a text area
- See a live preview of the rendered Markdown
- Download the preview as a PDF file

## Features

- Modern, responsive UI
- Live Markdown preview (powered by [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked))
